# Quick Time Stamper

Quick Time Stamper is an Obsidian plugin that adds a simple button to your notes. When you click the button, it replaces itself with the current timestamp. This can be useful for quickly logging the time of an event or action directly within your notes.

## Features

-   Adds a "Log Time" button to your notes.
-   Replaces the button with the current timestamp when clicked.

## Usage

1. Open a note in Obsidian.
2. Add the following code block to your note:

````markdown
`quick-timestamp-button`
````

3. When you view the note, you will see a "Log Time" button.
4. Click the "Log Time" button to replace it with the current timestamp.

## Example

Before clicking the button:

`````markdown
```quick-timestamp-button

```

after clicking the button:

````markdown
`2021-07-01T12:34:56-07:00`
````
`````
